      <h3 id="INCONTEC ">ssh</h3>
      <p>SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.</p> 
      <h3 id="Ethernet">sftp</h3>
      <p>SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a secure file transfer protocol that uses secure shell encryption to provide a high level of security for sending and receiving file transfers. </p> 
      <p>SFTP is similar to FTPS in that it uses AES and other algorithms to secure data as it travels between different systems. SFTP also provides several methods to fulfill the authentication of a connection such as user IDs and passwords, SSH keys, or combinations of these.</p>
      <h3 id="WEB">WEB</h3>
      <p>World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser.</p>
      <p>Web pages are formatted in a language called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It this language that allows users to click through pages on the Web via links. The Web uses HTTP protocol to transmit data and share information. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are used to access Web documents, or Web pages, which are connected via links.</p>
      <p>The Web is just one of the ways that information is shared over the Internet; others include email, instant messaging and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p>
      <h3 id="DHCP">DHCP</h3>
      <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.</p> 
      <h3 id="LAN">LAN</h3>
      <p>A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.</p> 
      <h3 id="MAN">MAN</h3>
      <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area, which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given large area with multiple buildings. A MAN is larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a wide area network (WAN). MANs do not have to be in urban areas; the term "metropolitan" implies the size of the network, not the demographics of the area that it serves.</p> 
      <h3 id="TIA">wan</h3>
      <p>A wide-area network (WAN) is the technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage together. It is called a wide-area network because it spans beyond a single building or large campus to include multiple locations spread across a specific geographic area, or even the world. </p> 
      <h3 id="IP">IP</h3>
      <p>IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network. In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication.</p> 
      <h3 id="EIA">HTTP</h3>
    <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol, standard application-level protocol used for exchanging files on the World Wide Web.</p> 
    <h3 id="HTTPS">HTTPS</h3>
    <p>HTTPS, meaning Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is the primary way to securely send data from a web browser to a website. HTTPS encrypts the data entered into a user's device to safely deliver it to the website they are interacting with. It also encrypts data going from the website to the browser.</p>
