        <h3 id="">SHELL</h3>
        <p>The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters.</p>
      <h3 id="">Rolling Release</h3>
      <p>Is a concept in software development of frequently delivering updates to applications.</p>
      <h3 id="">Static Release</h3>
      <p>All the software packages remain at the same version as long as that version of the operating system is under support, so the inter-package compatibility is excellent.</p>
      <h3 id="">Linux</h3>
      <p>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.</p>
      <h3 id="">Bash</h3>
      <p>Bourne-Again SHell is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system.</p>
      <h3 id="">Zsh</h3>
      <p>The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh</p>
      <h3 id="">Root Directory</h3>
      <p>The root directory, represented by a forward slash (/), stores all the directories in Linux. If you cd into this directory and use the ls command, you will find a list of all the directories on your machine. The absolute path of every file passes through the root directory as it is the parent to all other directories</p>
      <h3 id="">Arch</h3>
      <p>Arch Linux is a distribution targeted at experienced Linux users. It lets you have full responsibility and control over your system. You'll get to choose what packages you want, the kernel (yes there are multiple), the boot-loader, the desktop environment, and so on.</p>
      <p>This is because installing Arch Linux on a machine requires you to have proper knowledge of how different parts of a Linux distribution work. So running Arch Linux on your system is kind of a testament to your understanding of Linux</p>
      <h3>Hash</h3>
      <p>A hash is a mathematical function that converts an input of arbitrary length into an encrypted output of a fixed length. Thus, regardless of the original amount of data or file size involved, its unique hash will always be the same size. Moreover, hashes cannot be used to "reverse-engineer" the input from the hashed output since hash functions are "one-way" (like a meat grinder; you can't put the ground beef back into a steak). Still, if you use such a function on the same data, its hash will be identical, so you can validate that the data is the same (i.e., unaltered) if you already know its hash. 
        <p>Hashing is also essential to blockchain management in cryptocurrency. </p>
